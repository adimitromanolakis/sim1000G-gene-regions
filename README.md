# sim1000G-gene-regions
Gene regions from the GRCH37 1000 genomes data for use in sim1000G

# Generation of the files

The files were generated by the script: extract-genes.R

You can also generate the files locally:

1) Download the 1000 genomes data (see extract-genes.R for location)
2) Run extract-genes.R <chromosome> , where chromosome can be 1-22
3) Output file locations can be specified in the script
  

# Manual download
